BUILDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(The order is important here)
- Install Visual studio 2019 Community Edition: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- Open visual studio. Menu "Tools / Get Tools and Features"
- Install CUDA Toolkit 11.2 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
	(This needs to be done after visual studio install, so CUDA is registered into Visual Studio)

- Download the external libraries below and extract in the root. There should be a folder "external" in the repository "cpp" directory.

- In visual studio, open the smlm.sln. 
- Set the build to release mode, and build SMLMLibTest. This will also build the main library (SMLMLib)
- The final dll is photonpy.dll, which will be in x64/Release or x64/Debug


- Download python 64 bit and install. Make sure to add python to the PATH during installation
- Open command line
